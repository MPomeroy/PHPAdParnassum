# PHPAdParnassum
A PHP application to generate counterpoint that follows the rules of Johann Fux's Gradus Ad Parnassum.

This script is in a rought state, it generates a sample of first species counterpoint against a hard coded cantus firmus; I intend to expand this to parse cantus firmi from MusXML files and expand the number of counterpoint species that this script can handle.

Requirements: This script requires that my fork of PHPMusicXML be cloned or downloaded into /PHPadParnassum/lib.
